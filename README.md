# DNA-Microarray-Gene-Expression-Data-Classification-Using-SVM-MLP-and-RF-with-Feature-Selection-Met

## Overview
A DNA microarray (also commonly known as DNA chip or biochip) is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome.DNA microarray gene expression is being used to detect various forms of diseases. 
In this problem GÜÇKIRAN et al. have classified DNA microarray gene expression data using different classifiers and came to an end with the best one.Using multiple microarray datasets, this paper compares two different methods for classification and feature selection.They used 22 datasets but they didn't combine the datasets here, these are used individually.
We used these 22 datasets and applied on different classification. In our study we found out that LightGBM accuracy is the best among the other classification.

## Installing software and files
To do the project, we need to install some softwares and files. In this regard, we will be doing all the implementations in Python language on jupyter notebook. To install jupyter notebook and launch other application and files at first we have to download Anaconda which is free.

Link to Download Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/?modal=nucleus-commercial

Guideline for installing Anaconda : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-anaconda-on-windows/

Once Anaconda is downloaded and installed successfully, we may proceed to download Jupyter notebook.

## Download and Install Jupyter Notebook
Link to download Jupyter using Anaconda : https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/4.3.1/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/

## Using Google Colaboratory
For implementing the project with no configuration we can use Google Colaboratory as well.

## Installing Python libraries and packages
The required python libraries and packages are,
- pandas
- Numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
